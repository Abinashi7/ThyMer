## Welcome to Therapy Manager's project website

Therapy Manager comes from the need of therapists for a free platform that allows them to keep track of their patients. On this page you will find the latest developments on our project, the current features, and the future work, as well as information on how it works and on what techonologies is built on.

### Features

Therapy Manager allows mental health professionals to organize appointments and keep track of their patients through patient profiles. Each patient profile contains patient demographic information, medication usage, previous/current diagnoses, and previous/future appointments. Clicking on an appointment brings up a notepad component that allows health professionals to view and edit notes for that appointment. Additionally, users will be able to upload other relevant patient documents such as blood and urine reports, hospital records, and results from physicals.

### Technologies used

Therapy Manager's frontend is built on React using a MongoDB database and NodeJS as backend.

### Future work

We are aware for the need of certain features that due to the scope of the project will not be developed right now. Features such as storing and/or transcription of session's voice recordings, integration with email or sms notifiactions to the patients and the therapist, and many others are left as future work or future collaborations.
